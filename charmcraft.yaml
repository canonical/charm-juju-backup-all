# Learn more about charmcraft.yaml configuration at:
# https://juju.is/docs/sdk/charmcraft-config
type: "charm"
# Note(sudeephb): We are using prebuilt binray wheel of the paramiko package.
# The reason for this is that if we let it build from source when building the
# charm, it causes platform dependence for compiled components of libraries like
# cryptography, which is a dependency of paramiko. Consequently, a charm built on
# focal fails to run on jammy and vice versa.
# Care should be taken while specifying binary wheels so as not to use incompatible builds. 
# According to the compatibility table:
# https://github.com/mayeut/pep600_compliance/blob/master/DETAILS.rst,
# manylinux_2_28 is compatible with 18.10+
# manylinux_2_24 is compatible with 16.10+
# manylinux_2014 is compatible with 12.04+

# Note(sudeephb): The charm is built on 20.04 and not 22.04
# because the one built on 22.04 fails to install on 18.04 because 
# of breaking differences in default python versions.
